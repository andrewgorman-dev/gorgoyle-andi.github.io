- To learn coding I built a static website documenting some of my work as a freelance composer and jazz violinist over the past 7 years.
- I used some online tutorials and library books to learn. And lots of trial and error
- Special thanks to  Udemy and Traversy Media and one Web Dev Ed tutorial that got me started
- Icons and logos my designs mostly using GIMP
- Audio player designs adapted from Traversy Media tutorials but unique flavours and customisation added by me as part of my learning curve
