# A static website documenting some of my work as a freelance composer and jazz violinist over the past 7 years.
# My very first coding project using HTML CSS SASS and Vanilla Javascript
# Special thanks to a few Udemy and Traversy Media Youtube tutorials that got me started
# Icons and logos my designs mostly using GIMP
# Audio player designs adapted from Traversy Media tutorials but unique flavours and customisation added by me as part of my learning curve
