          <h4>
            Improvisation is neurologically singular. Studying it can benefit
            anyone!
          </h4>
          <img src="../images/research-images/brain-img1.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            It is known that improvisation is a distinct musical ability but
            what then are the unique advantages gained from the study of
            improvisation? Is something fundamental lacking in the education of
            musicians who cannot improvise? Is spontaneous creativity useful for
            education across the board? What are other potential advantages of
            engagement with improvisation for personal, psychological and
            organisational development in both individuals and groups? What
            light can the brains of jazz musicians shed on these questions?
          </p>
          <p>
            Using a literary research method this thesis presents an overview
            and discussion of key neuroimaging results from the first fMRI
            experiments ever to explicitly separate musical improvisation from
            prepared musical performance. As a path into the discussion, studies
            from recent decades in the field of music cognition are discussed in
            connection with psycholinguistic results pertaining to language
            cognition. It begins with a core question about the extent to which
            music may be compared with language - often cited as “the most
            everyday form of improvisation among humans” - since in the points
            of similarity and departure with linguistic improvisation, lies the
            key to understanding the benefits of this type of cognitive
            training. The aim of the ensuing discussion is to discover a
            scientific basis for the existence of connections between neurology,
            psychology and the ‘jazz mentality’ that are also relevant in
            everyday life not only in a professional musical career.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/research-images/brain-img2.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            Specific fMRI experiments targeting what we may call ‘jazz
            cognition’ reveal patterns of activation and deactivation in both
            prefrontal and classical language areas suggesting a healthy
            absorption in the task of improvisation that correlates with modern
            conceptions of the ‘flow’ state. Flow states are becoming
            increasingly cited by psychologists and neuroscientists in analyses
            of cognitive processes with positive effects on both physical and
            mental health. Multiple other experiments using fMRI, EEG and PET
            scans are discussed in relation to both music and language
            cognition. These explain preexisting accepted theories as to the
            benefits of music education in general before extending them to
            incorporate the new data surrounding improvisation. Surveys by
            psychologists and musicologists who have collected large amounts of
            data relating to personality traits in musicians and students from
            different genres are also compared with and analysed in light of
            these neurological results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, this study investigates how ‘jazz wisdom' (in this context
            meaning the application of lessons obtained uniquely from
            improvisational studies) has become increasingly cited by
            progressive thinkers in broader contexts beyond the realm of music.
            These include: organisational science, embodied cognition and calls
            to improve the hierarchical structures in the workplace and to
            direct the long-term goals of education systems towards a society
            with higher self-awareness.

          <h4>Key Players</h4>
          <p>
            My research introduced me to some of the key neuroscientists
            investigating the uniqueness of improvisation's associated cognitive
            processes today. Unsurprisingly many of them are also musicians, in
            some cases even accomplished ones. I have included links to lectures
            by many of them in my
            <a href="#gallery" target="_blank">gallery below.</a> These were
            some of the videos I was most intrigued by having decided to
            research positive effects of the study of improvisation on body and
            mind.

          <h4>Structural Note</h4>
          <p>
            My thesis is divided into an introduction plus three research
            chapters and a conclusion. The three research chapters describe,
            analyse and juxtapose the main experiments and journals that have
            most recently been carried out and published in the field of musical
            improvisation neuroscience. The results discovered thus far are
            truly fascinating and seem to correspond to the life-lessons I have
            personally discovered through my own study of improvisation. If you

          <h3>About Andrew</h3>
          <p>
            I am a life-long learner. The art of learning has become as much a
            passion as the various disciplines to which I have had the privilege
            to apply it. My own path has led me through mathematics and
            languages to jazz improvisation, composition and, most recently,
            learning to code. The progression however has not necessarily been
            linear. The connections discovered at a deep level build bridges
            through time allowing for a multidimensional standpoint. I believe
            that good teachers are able to draw on their own personal experience
            of learning but are unwise to be bound by it. In reality, a good
            teacher must learn how to teach each student as much as the student
            is obliged to discover a teacher's secrets. I have lived, learned,
            made mistakes and improved my various models for learning through
            tinkering and experimentation. I appreciate mathematics for its
            noble attempt to explain the wonders of the universe and for its
            countless practical applications but even more so for its power to
            sharpen our minds. I respect languages for the insight they offer
            into humanity and cultures. I love music for how it makes me feel. I
            would enjoy helping anyone who wishes to make progress in any of
            these fields. I myself am currently learning to code. As I do so I
            can immediately identify parallels between programming, music and
            languages. When we learn to improvise in a style we begin by
            learning phrases and sounds just as the linguist learns at first and
            similarly to how programmers learn the functions and operators of
            the various languages.
