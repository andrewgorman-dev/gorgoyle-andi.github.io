            Fourchestra formed in 2018 when four acoustic jazz musicians got
            together to play some shows. Originally the band was to play for
            private parties and functions but within a few months of playing
            together they decided to meet regularly to work on original
            compositions and arrangements on top of their basis repertoire of
            standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fourchestra is a former project of mine together with fellow
            violinist/composer/arranger, Milan Wisiak designed to extend the
            repertoire of traditional acoustic jazz. It was fundamentally based
            on a way of aiming to play jazz on the violin without falling into
            the trap of playing 'jazz-violin'. As such the inspiration for
            repertoire was the bigband in all its multifaceted glory.
          </p>
          <img
            src="../images/4k-images/4k-stand-play.jpg"
            alt="4k stand play"
          />
          <p>
            The arrangements were designed to feature extended violin techniques
            while emulating horn-section-style backings and shout-choruses
            giving the feeling of a larger section despite using only two melody
            players. These included left-hand techniques such as double stops
            weaved into two-voice melodic lines to create supplementary passages
            of three and even four-part harmony in the style of three and
            four-way close voicings one would find in big band music. Right-hand
            techniques such as chopping, balzando (in combination with left-hand
            pizzicato) and sul ponticello playing were also used to create
            additional grooves and colours.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fourchestra formed originally having auditioned to work in
            conjunction with
            <a href="https://www.livemusicnow.at/" target="_blank"
              ><i>Live Music Now</i></a
            >
            performing in schools, homeless shelters, retirement homes and
            potentially even in prisons (although this sadly never transpired)
            in and around Vienna. At the same time the band was in demand for
            private parties and functions including literary nature walks in
            Waldviertel.
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            For two years Fourchestra continued producing innovative
            arrangements and original compositions culminating in the recording
            of an EP (see above).
          </p>
          <p>
            With three band members based in Vienna and one in Linz it wasn't
            easy to maintain regular rehearsals and with the arrival of Covid-19
            restrictions the band went into early retirement.

          <h3>About Andrew</h3>
          <p>
            I am a life-long learner. The art of learning has become as much a
            passion as the various disciplines to which I have had the privilege
            to apply it. My own path has led me through mathematics and
            languages to jazz improvisation, composition and, most recently,
            learning to code. The progression however has not necessarily been
            linear. The connections discovered at a deep level build bridges
            through time allowing for a multidimensional standpoint. I believe
            that good teachers are able to draw on their own personal experience
            of learning but are unwise to be bound by it. In reality, a good
            teacher must learn how to teach each student as much as the student
            is obliged to discover a teacher's secrets. I have lived, learned,
            made mistakes and improved my various models for learning through
            tinkering and experimentation. I appreciate mathematics for its
            noble attempt to explain the wonders of the universe and for its
            countless practical applications but even more so for its power to
            sharpen our minds. I respect languages for the insight they offer
            into humanity and cultures. I love music for how it makes me feel. I
            would enjoy helping anyone who wishes to make progress in any of
            these fields. I myself am currently learning to code. As I do so I
            can immediately identify parallels between programming, music and
            languages. When we learn to improvise in a style we begin by
            learning phrases and sounds just as the linguist learns at first and
            similarly to how programmers learn the functions and operators of
            the various languages.
