          <p>
            Joshua Middleton defies definition. His musical virtuosity is
            surpassed only by his ingenious character itself. In Josh's presence
            the world feels like a more exciting place full of good vibes and
            possibility. As a professional accordionist Josh specialises in
            Klezmer and East European Folk styles, however, he also plays a wide
            range of styles such as English/Scottish/Irish Folk, French Chanson,
            Manouche Jazz. He has been performing music professionally since the
            age of 14, graduated from the School of Oriental and African Studies
            with a first class degree in Ethnomusicology, and has since been
            working as a freelance musician while studying both Klezmer and
            Bulgarian music, the latter at the Academy of Music, Dance and Fine
            Arts, Plovdiv. Josh has worked with many Klezmer and Balkan music
            ensembles such as She’koyokh and The London Klezmer Quartet, has
            shared a stage with Klezmorim such as Frank London and Merlin
            Shepherd, taught at Klezfest London alongside Klezmer scholars such
            as Alan Bern and Joel Rubin, and recorded for artists as diverse as
            DJ Vadim and Kadialy Kouyate.

          <p>
            Eric Jacquin is a master luthier. He specialises in building the
            finest electric 5-string violins I have ever heard. I am a proud
            owner of one of his 5-string Baritone masterpieces. He makes models
            with 4 or 5 strings and his violins are available in STANDARD range
            or in BARITONE version (with octaved strings, to enjoy the full
            tonal range of the cello, while keeping the ease of play of a
            classical violin). Their organic and very light designed violin body
            produces a natural sound, rich in harmonics, highlighting the warm
            vibrations of highly resonant woods. The solid carved body is
            conceived to increase the dynamic of sound vibration, that's why all
            the nuances of traditional violin playing are very easy to express.
            The use of electric effects is enriched with a precise and warm
            dynamic sound without feedback problems. The tuning of the strings
            is done with Wittner mechanical pegs which have a traditional
            appearance of the outside, are very light and they allow to have a
            fine adjustment directly under the hand.

          <h3>About Andrew</h3>
          <p>
            I am a life-long learner. The art of learning has become as much a
            passion as the various disciplines to which I have had the privilege
            to apply it. My own path has led me through mathematics and
            languages to jazz improvisation, composition and, most recently,
            learning to code. The progression however has not necessarily been
            linear. The connections discovered at a deep level build bridges
            through time allowing for a multidimensional standpoint. I believe
            that good teachers are able to draw on their own personal experience
            of learning but are unwise to be bound by it. In reality, a good
            teacher must learn how to teach each student as much as the student
            is obliged to discover a teacher's secrets. I have lived, learned,
            made mistakes and improved my various models for learning through
            tinkering and experimentation. I appreciate mathematics for its
            noble attempt to explain the wonders of the universe and for its
            countless practical applications but even more so for its power to
            sharpen our minds. I respect languages for the insight they offer
            into humanity and cultures. I love music for how it makes me feel. I
            would enjoy helping anyone who wishes to make progress in any of
            these fields. I myself am currently learning to code. As I do so I
            can immediately identify parallels between programming, music and
            languages. When we learn to improvise in a style we begin by
            learning phrases and sounds just as the linguist learns at first and
            similarly to how programmers learn the functions and operators of
            the various languages.
