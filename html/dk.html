            <p>Having discovered a couple of heroic klezmorim, Tim Karp and Daniel Gouly at jam sessions during my masters studies
              I resolved to form a band to explore klezmer music and an array of related styles from which this rich genre draws influence. 
              The goal was to put the music first, to come together regularly to play and arrange the music allowing our own
              experience to guide us toward original interpretations. After meeting a groove-mad Devonshire bassist, Jamie Benzies 
              during my brief but highly educational season with London's finest Samba collective, "Rhythms of the City", our original
              4-piece line up was complete. We played our first gig at a (pretty kitsch) Arabian-night-themed event at the swanky Dorchester
              hotel on Park Lane in London.
            </p>
            <p>Soon thereafter Jamie brought his housemate (and by 'house' I mean amazing former pub right in the heart of the city) 
              and partner-in-groove Tim Doyle in to play drums and thereby took Don Kipper to a new level of potential for combining
              exciting beats with our growing repertoire of melodies</p>
            <p>After crashing his house party on my birthday in 2012 I found myself face to face with the inimitable 
              accordionist, Josh Middleton whose bedroom already told the tale of a most singular minstrel destined for rare greatness. A few days later
              we were jamming in my bedroom and the deal was sealed. Don Kipper was now a sextet.</p>
              <img src="../images/dk-images/dk-fidels-gastro.jpeg" alt="fidels gastro">
            <p>For nearly a year Don Kipper was largely an instrumental venture. Although we did love singing we often lacked
              the pronunciation skills for the relevant languages to our chosen styles.
              On the lookout for a fitting singer we trialed many an exciting vocalist but somehow things never clicked. 
              That was until one balmy night at the legendary Jamboree venue down cable street ways. The gem of the Limehouse basin.
              That evening during our break between sets I felt a magnetic force drawing me towards a young man and a shy-looking lady.
              Greek? And Serbian? Knows all our music and loves to sing?! Could there ever have been a clearer candidate for sitting in on a rehearsal?
              That was Wednesday evening. By Friday lunchtime Dunja Botic was the singer and seventh member of Don Kipper. 
              By Sunday night it felt like she'd been in the band for years. We were finally complete.</p>
            <p> Having produced, recorded and released their <a href="https://donkipper.bandcamp.com/album/don-kipper" target="_blank">self-titled first album</a> Don Kipper toured Europe performing in festivals and venues and gained international recogition winning a Klezmer 
              competition in Munich in 2015. <img src="../images/dk-images/dk-theAlbum.jpg" alt="Dk The Album">
            </p>
            <p>After a period of touring Don Kipper returned to the studio (otherwise known as Tim's bedroom) to record the 
              <a href="https://donkipper.bandcamp.com/album/krisalis" target="_blank">Krisallis EP</a> that featured some of their first fully-original material.
              <img src="../images/dk-images/Krisallis-art.jpg" alt="Krisallis Cover"></p>
            <p>In the summer of 2018 Kipper signed with Riverboat Records to produce their third album <a href="https://www.donkipper.com/new-album-seven-sisters" target="_blank">Seven Sisters</a>, 
              a personal and intimate homage to the band's home in north-east London. <img src="../images/dk-images/Welcome.jpg" alt="Seven Sisters Cover">
            </p>
            <p>In 2019 on the Croatian Island, Vis I parted ways with my first metaphorical baby, Don Kipper to concentrate on raising my 
              first biological baby, Vincent in my new home, Vienna.

          <h3>About Andrew</h3>
          <p>
            I am a life-long learner. The art of learning has become as much a
            passion as the various disciplines to which I have had the privilege
            to apply it. My own path has led me through mathematics and
            languages to jazz improvisation, composition and, most recently,
            learning to code. The progression however has not necessarily been
            linear. The connections discovered at a deep level build bridges
            through time allowing for a multidimensional standpoint. I believe
            that good teachers are able to draw on their own personal experience
            of learning but are unwise to be bound by it. In reality, a good
            teacher must learn how to teach each student as much as the student
            is obliged to discover a teacher's secrets. I have lived, learned,
            made mistakes and improved my various models for learning through
            tinkering and experimentation. I appreciate mathematics for its
            noble attempt to explain the wonders of the universe and for its
            countless practical applications but even more so for its power to
            sharpen our minds. I respect languages for the insight they offer
            into humanity and cultures. I love music for how it makes me feel. I
            would enjoy helping anyone who wishes to make progress in any of
            these fields. I myself am currently learning to code. As I do so I
            can immediately identify parallels between programming, music and
            languages. When we learn to improvise in a style we begin by
            learning phrases and sounds just as the linguist learns at first and
            similarly to how programmers learn the functions and operators of
            the various languages.
