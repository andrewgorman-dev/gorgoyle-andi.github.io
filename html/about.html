        <p>
          My professional life has been centred around creating music and
          teaching a variety of subjects. The common theme has been my pursuit
          of free thought and self-discovery through learning and the expansion
          of my own horizons. In addition to violin and music theory I teach
          Mathematics, Reasoning (Verbal and Non-Verbal) French and German, the
          two additional languages I have picked up and studied on my travels. I
          have performed with various bands over the past seven years all
          incorporating the practice of improvisation within the respective
          styles. More recently I have worked as a solo artist using looping
          technology to perform as a singer-songwriter. I currently live in
          Vienna. The most recent development for me has been learning that of
          the web. Ultimately I have aimed to live without separation between
          work and life-interests. Creating and learning have been constants for
          as long as I can remember. This is a new direction for me to which so
          much of the musical wisdom I have been lucky enough to encounter
          applies. Here is a summary of my current professional occupations:

          Since September 2020 I have been teaching jazz violin at the

            >JSBM Popakademie in Vienna</a
          >
          For one academic year I supervised students of all levels including professional classical players
          who are learning more about improvisation and groove music on the
          violin or viola. For students enrolled on specific courses at the
          college my teaching follows a programmme that runs in tandem with
          supplementary courses in ear-training and playing in ensembles. Whilst
          the repertoire is based around jazz and its derivative styles there is
          often room to include other music with which I have personal
          experience such as irish folk, klezmer and eastern european fiddle
          tunes. More information about studying jazz violin at the J.S Bach

        >
        <p>
          For twelve years I have worked with one of the U.K's most successful
          tuition agencies. I began working with
          <a

          >
          in 2009 after completing my first Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and
          French. Initially I offered tuition in those two subjects up to and
          including A-level but having studied composition at Trinity Laban
          (London) and having subsequently retrained as a music teacher in
          Vienna I now frequently work with students towards GCSE and A-level
          Music also. My life as a freelance musician has also led to a lot of
          experience with music technology so my tuition of composition often
          extends to include the recording and mixing process within my DAWs of
          choice. I also teach verbal and non-verbal reasoning and physics.

        <p>
          I have worked as a freelance composer and violinist since 2013. I
          began writing and performing in my home town, London where I founded
          my first band,
          <a href="dk.html" target="_blank">Don Kipper</a> whose success
          throughout the U.K and Europe gave me a musical passport that
          introduced me to so many exciting places I may never have seen without
          it. I moved to Vienna in 2016 where I retrained as a jazz-violin
          teacher completing a second Bachelor's degree in Music Education
          (Instrumental- und Gesangs-PÃ¤dagogik). For the first two years of
          transition I still returned to the U.K (or travelled to other
          countries) to perform with Don Kipper but in late 2018 I decided to
          say goodbye to the band that kick-started my career in order to focus
          on more jazz-based projects in Vienna.

          that offered free instrumental and vocal teaching to refugees living
          in temporary accommodation in and around Vienna. The project brings
          students from refugee backgrounds together at universities to learn
          and perform music. The set up is always geared towards learning to
          sing and play instruments whilst creating an ensemble comprising every
          student that is capable of performing a short set by the end of each
          semester. Originally I taught group violin lessons but since September

        <h3>BSc Maths with French (Manchester: 2005 - 2009)</h3>
        <p>
          Immediately after completing my A-levels I was awarded a
          <a
            href="../documents/Man-Scholarship.pdf"
            download="A.Gorman Manchester Scholarship"
            >scholarship
          </a>
          to study Mathematics with a subsidiary in French at the University of
          Manchester. I was very interested in pure maths especially the fields
          of number theory and proof. That a mathematical theorem could be
          proven beyond all doubt (given just a handful of axioms) was
          fascinating to me at the time. I chose the Manchester course not only
          for the scholarship that came with it but for the opportunity it
          afforded me to spend a year abroad in Paris. This allowed me to spend
          time studying literature and philosophy at the Sorbonne. I also took
          my violin back out of the box and learnt the rudiments of jazz
          improvisation at <i>"boeufs de Manouche"</i> jam sessions I returned
          to Manchester in 2009 to complete my Bachelor degree with first class
          honours before moving my life back towards music.

        <h3>MMus Composition (Trinity Laban: 2010 - 2012)</h3>
        <p>
          During my time at Manchester I had begun building a portfolio of
          compositions. Having completed my Maths degree I took a year to
          prepare for a musical masters at Trinity Laban, a conservatoire in
          which I was particularly interested for its strong jazz department and
          collaboration with contemporary dancers. While at Trinity I
          collaborated with
          <a href="film-music.html" target="_blank"
            >film-makers, dancers and jazz musicians</a
          >
          eventually performing my own material with scratch ensembles and
          collectives. While at Trinity I began attending the jam sessions that
          would later lead to the founding of
          <a href="dk.html" target="_blank">Don Kipper</a>. I was also
          lucky enough to have the opportunity of arranging klezmer music for
          Trinity's largest Wind Band. I graduated with Postgraduate Distinction
          in June 2012.

        <h3>BAME Jazz Violin (Vienna: 2017 - 2021)</h3>
        <p>
          Having moved to Vienna in 2016 I began training as a Jazz Violin
          teacher. During my studies I became fluent in German and consolidated
          my compositional studies with two years of Jazz theory and
          arrangement. While studying I became heavily involved in community
          projects working with

            >Live Music Now</a
          >
          offering free musical training to refugee students in and around
          Vienna. Whilst studying at the Jam Music Lab I co-founded the band
          <a href="4k.html" target="_blank">Fourchestra</a> with fellow
          students, a project dedicated to expanding the scope of acoustic
          'chamber'-jazz ensembles. I wrote my thesis on the unique effects of

            >improvisation on the human brain</a

          My life is all about discovery and leaping into the unknown in order
          to challenge myself and extend my limits as far as I can. Coding for
          me means moving forward at this stage in my life. That's why I decided
          to build this website from scratch. I am currently self-teaching but
          will be joining a boot-camp shortly in September 2021 to further hone
          my skills. Sofar I have enjoyed learning Python, Javascript (in tandem
          with HTML5 and CSS3) and exploring mini projects using LAMP stacks. As
          a fledgling web-developer I am currently happy to work with
          interesting people and start-ups at astonishingly low-rates in order
          to learn the trade in a zero-plus game situation for both of us. Feel
          free to contact me if this applies to you. But hurry! I don't intend
          to be cheap for very long ð.

          <h3>About Andrew</h3>
          <p>
            I am a life-long learner. The art of learning has become as much a
            passion as the various disciplines to which I have had the privilege
            to apply it. My own path has led me through mathematics and
            languages to jazz improvisation, composition and, most recently,
            learning to code. The progression however has not necessarily been
            linear. The connections discovered at a deep level build bridges
            through time allowing for a multidimensional standpoint. I believe
            that good teachers are able to draw on their own personal experience
            of learning but are unwise to be bound by it. In reality, a good
            teacher must learn how to teach each student as much as the student
            is obliged to discover a teacher's secrets. I have lived, learned,
            made mistakes and improved my various models for learning through
            tinkering and experimentation. I appreciate mathematics for its
            noble attempt to explain the wonders of the universe and for its
            countless practical applications but even more so for its power to
            sharpen our minds. I respect languages for the insight they offer
            into humanity and cultures. I love music for how it makes me feel. I
            would enjoy helping anyone who wishes to make progress in any of
            these fields. I myself am currently learning to code. As I do so I
            can immediately identify parallels between programming, music and
            languages. When we learn to improvise in a style we begin by
            learning phrases and sounds just as the linguist learns at first and
            similarly to how programmers learn the functions and operators of
            the various languages.
